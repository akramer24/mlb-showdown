# MLB SHOWDOWN

The best card game ever, MLB Showdown, has been brought to life online.

Users can buy packs of cards and pit their team against someone else's on a game-board rendered by React and React-Redux. Game state is transferred from client to client via Socket.io, and players can talk smack
in the WebRTC video chat.
